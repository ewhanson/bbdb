# What's new

## 2023-06-19

The biggest Babygramz update yet!

A lot went into making sure the app continues to be maintainable and extensible over time, but I was also able to add a number of user-facing features that had been on my mind for a while, so without further ado:

- This "what's new" page. Incremental changes made over time can be hard to track and notice. I wanted to add an update log to keep track of what I've done, what's new, and provide a way for others to see the recent changes as well.
- New photos now have a "new" badge that will show up on any new photos for a week or until the next batch of new photos are uploaded.
- A more robust way of tracking new photos/queueing new photo emails. The previous method was a bit flaky and made it difficult to reliably trigger new photo notifications when anything else went wrong (like restarting the computer...). That should be a thing of the past now.
- Tags! Tags can now be added to group and categorizes photos. The tags are visible beneath the photo description, and each tag has its own dedicated page where all photos with that tag can be viewed together.
- Update badges on the dropdown menu. These serve as an additional visual indicator when there's something new (whether it be an update here in the "What's new" section or new photos being added). Still an early idea so I'll have to see how it goes and whether it's intrusive or not.
