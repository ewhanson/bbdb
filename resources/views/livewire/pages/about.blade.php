        <h1>About Babygramz</h1>
        <p>
            Thanks for visiting! Babygramz is a digital scrapbook for sharing
            photos with friends and family. It allows you to create a
            password-protected photo feed with the ethos of a physical scrapbook
            and feel of a modern social media app. For now, the project is limited
            to a single user/photo feed, but I'd like to expand and open-source it
            in the future.
